# NUMBER26 Code Challenge

#### Provide a single web page containing:

- a header
- a footer
- a registration form for some kind of service


#### Issues

- Back button on final form page sometimes positioned wrongly


#### Brief

The main focus of this challenge for me was to deliver the requirements within the time given. Once I achieved the deliverables, I then went on to adding the bonus features.

I was particularly interested in laying the based site with the form, then working on UI interaction to make the site more intuitive. Once I managed to get the site working, I then made media queries to break the site down into difference device view windows, this was one of the highlights as it helped me practice my responsiveness development.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of the challenge was working with the JavaScript and JQuery, researching and finding solutions to the problems I came across, and debugging when events did not work.

Another highlight was designing the form to function over 4 form pages, this helped break the form into more readable sections for the user. Allowing for a more friendly form experience.



#### If I had more time

- I would split the concerns into different files, this would help break large chunks of code into smaller, managable section.
- Do further testing of the functionality
- Add a backend to the site and save the form data.
